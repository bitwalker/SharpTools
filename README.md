SharpTools
============

A collection of useful C# code to build upon. Why waste time writing what's already been done well?

## Goals

This project is my attempt to collate things that I need on a regular basis for C# projects. It is my intent to meet the following goals:

- All modules have an associated test suite
- All code has a consistent style
- All code is documented, and each module has an associated README with high-level documentation explaining it's purpose and use.
- This library will be made available via NuGet, and will use semantic versioning.
- This library will be updated to work with the latest version of C#/.NET once available.
- Major version increments reflect moving language/framework support to the latest available version, i.e. upon release of C#6, 1.x will become 2.x.
- Minor version increments reflect API changes.
- Build version increments reflect feature additions/bug fixes/refactorings that do not affect the public API.


## Roadmap

Slowly porting my random folder full of code to either the trash can, or to this library. This involves adding more tests, updating code style/documentation, etc.
